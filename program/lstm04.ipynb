out of the last 9 calls to <function Model.make_predict_function.<locals>.predict_function at 0x7fb7f1765710> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n","2/2 [==============================] - 0s 12ms/step\n","(200, 1)\n","[[0.01868984]\n"," [0.00565045]\n"," [0.9912696 ]\n"," [0.00176182]\n"," [0.99049765]]\n","accuracy = 56.99999999999999 %\n"]}]}]}
